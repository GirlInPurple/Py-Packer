# Settings.TXT explained
- default version (set to 1.19.2)
- default file location (set to the programs file location)
- color toggle (text colors on by default, can toggle in case it either becomes unsupported or breaks something else)

# Known Issues
- Now semi functional when ran outside of VScode, still some issues with Settings loading and colors, i think i figured out a fix for the colors, not so much the settings.
- Due to OS limitations, you cant have 2 of the same "data" folder without manualy creating it. The "_0" fix is being used as of now, but it requries you to go into the files and edit the folder names manually.

Anyone is free to modify, contribute, or change this program in any way you see fit.
