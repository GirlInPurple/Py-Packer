# Py-Packer
A work in progress CUI based pack maker for Java 1.19.2 Minecraft

## Plans:
- Datapack Creation Helper
- Resource Pack Maker (simplifies the process)
- Scarpet code generator with a syntax similar to Scratch

## Contributors:
- <b>@OrigamingWasTaken</b> (original creator of DataCreate.py, a part of this projects foundation [(click here)](https://github.com/OrigamingWasTaken/DataCreate))
- <b>@AnhNguyenlost13</b> (helping with testing in other evironments)

## Known Issues
- Due to OS limitations, you cant have 2 of the same "data" folder without manualy creating it. The "_0" fix is being used as of now, but it requries you to go into the files and edit the folder names manually.
- This project will not work on most-if not all-Linux distros. I have no plans to change that.

## Files Created
3 files will be created, 1 file checked:
- A "output" folder will be created
- A "settings.txt" file will be created then writen in immediately
- A random photo grabbed off Wikipedia as test image later
- One of Window's audio files will be checked so it can be used as a test sound later (specifically, "Alarm01", with the filepath C:Windows\Media\Alarm01)

## First Startup
When you first launch PyPacker, you can review the settings or just skip past it immediately, no matter what it will have to restart to put you on the main menu.

Anyone is free to modify, contribute, or change this program in any way you see fit.
