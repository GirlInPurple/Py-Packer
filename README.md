# Settings.TXT explained
- default version (set to 1.19.2)
- default file location (set to the programs file location)
- color toggle (text colors on by default, can toggle incase it either becomes unsupported or breaks something)
- first login (also an unintentional log-in counter, used for setting up default at the start)
- debug mode (false by default)

# Known Issues
- Straight up refuses to launch on anything else but VScode, and when it does colors are all messed up; good news, works perfect in said VScode!
- Due to OS limitations, you cant name 2 packs the same thing, a change is planned that will add "_1" at the end of duplicate packs.
- settings.txt has some issues atm, specifially chossen version refuses to load
